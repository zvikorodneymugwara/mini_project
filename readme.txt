Additional features and functionalities of the application include:
    
    Voting for SRC
    Notifications for processed user requests
    Tracking course progression
    Tracking module test performance
    The use of the blockchain to verify a student's degree

login credentials can be found in the user credentials text file or below:

    Student Number: 221100999
    Student Number (Admin): 201100101
    Each user has the same password: hashed_password

Binary files for testing and referencing will be automatically generated when the program runs. After running, they can be deleted, the program will just recreate them.

Client server architecture is used for the network, run the server class first before launching the application.
    Path to Server.java: src\app\network\Server.java
    Path to Main.java: src\Main.java
